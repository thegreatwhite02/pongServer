General Info
============
To run our application, begin by running pongServer.py.
***IMPORTANT: When you run pongServer.py, it is important that you change whatever local IP you are using to be the first string argument of 
server.bind() in pongServer.py. 

When pongServer.py is running, run two separate client scripts and enter in the IP Address and 12321 as the port for both. 
***IMPORTANT: The client scripts must be in the same folder as pongServer.py. (All should be within the "pong" folder)

The game should then be up and running!
